    Github Repository Viewer
</h1>

This is a ReactJS application developed during [Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp) in order to allow users to see the issues of their favorite github repositories using github API. Data is saved in local storage and users are allowed to add or remove as many repositories as they want. The app validates if the repository is valid or duplicated and the issues can be filtered by opened, closed or all.

## :rocket: Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovanniantonaccio/github-repo-viewer.git
```
